# Camunda Helm Test

This directory contains unit tests for the Camunda Helm chart. For more information about the tests and how to extend them please read our [contribution guidelines](../../../../README.md#contributing).

## Running Tests

By default, tests run with minimal logging to reduce verbosity. If you need to see detailed logs for debugging, you can enable verbose logging:

```bash
VERBOSE_TEST_LOGGING=true go test ./...
```
