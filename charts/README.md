# Camunda 8 Helm Charts

## Release Cycles

Camunda provides a standard support policy of **18 months from the date it is released**. During this time, patches are regularly released containing security and bug fixes, some of which may come from dependency updates. Therefore, for the vast majority of dependencies Camunda only applies patch updates.
