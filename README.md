## Versioning

Since the 8.4 release (January 2024), the Camunda Helm chart version has been decoupled from the version of the application (e.g., the chart version is 9.0.0 and the application version is 8.4.x).

For more details, check out the [full version matrix](./camunda-platform/version-matrix/).

## Installing Charts

Follow [the instructions in the Camunda Platform documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/install/) to install the Camunda Platform to a K8s cluster.

Check the repo branch for more technical details:
[camunda/camunda-platform-helm](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm)

## Configure Charts

Helm charts can be configured by using extra values files or directly via the `--set` option.

helm install camunda camunda/camunda-platform --set zeebe.prometheusServiceMonitor.enabled=true
```

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```shell
helm uninstall camunda
```

The command above will remove the Helm chart installation but will leave the PVCs which holds the data
for the applications. To remove the PVCs, please run the following:

> [!CAUTION]
> This will remove the installation data permenantly.

```shell
kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=camunda
```

Or delete the related Kubernetes namespace, which contains all of the chart resources.
