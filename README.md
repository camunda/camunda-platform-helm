```

  - [Zeebe](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md#zeebe)
  - [Zeebe Gateway](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md#zeebe-gateway)
  - [Operate](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md#operate)
  - [Tasklist](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md#tasklist)

> ***Note**: check the [kind/ccsm-kind-values](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/kind/ccsm-kind-values.yaml) file to get camunda-platform running with kind*


## Configure Charts

Helm charts can be configured via using extra values files or directly via the `--set` option. make sure to check out the [CCSM-HELM Readme](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md) for more information.

Example to enable the prometheus servicemonitor for Zeebe:

```sh
helm install <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME> camunda-cloud/camunda-platform --set zeebe.prometheusServiceMonitor.enabled=true
```

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```
helm uninstall <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
```

> Notice that all the services and pods will be deleted, but not the Persistence Volume Claims which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and Elasticsearch. In order to free up the storage you need to manually delete all the Persistent Volume Claims. You can do this by running:

```
kubectl get pvc
```

Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:

```
kubectl delete pvc <PVC ids here>
```

Or delete the related kubernetes namespace, which contains the resources.

## Deprecation of zeebe charts

With the creation of the Camunda Cloud Self Managed (CCSM) helm charts, the old zeebe-* charts have been deprecated.
This means they are no longer part of the repository and no longer maintained. The packaged charts are still available
for download.

The following charts are deprecated:

 * zeebe-full-helm
 * zeebe-cluster-helm
 * zeebe-operate-helm
 * zeebe-tasklist-helm

The new `camunda-platform` chart is a full replacement of `zeebe-full-helm` and replaces (contains) all other charts as sub-charts.
All sub-charts in `camunda-platform` are per default enabled.

For a complete migration guide see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/MIGRATION.md).
